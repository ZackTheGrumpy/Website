When enabled, closing the ONENNABE window keeps the app running in the **system tray** (bottom-right corner of the taskbar) instead of fully exiting.

- Right-click the tray icon to open or exit the app
- Useful if you want ONENNABE to stay running in the background

### Always Ask Before Closing

When enabled, ONENNABE will always ask whether to **minimize to tray** or **quit** when you close the window.

When disabled, ONENNABE remembers your last choice and applies it automatically without asking.
