    - **Secure Boot** — sometimes needs to be **turned off**
    - **Test Signing Mode** — sometimes needs to be **turned on**
    
    HV Tools will tell you which of these apply to your system.

## Bypass Hypervisor Guide

Once prerequisites are complete, follow these steps to bypass:

### Step 1 — Turn Off Memory Integrity

1. Open **Windows Security**
2. Go to **Device Security** → **Core Isolation**
3. Turn off **Memory Integrity**

!!! note
    Memory Integrity is off by default on most systems. If it is already off, skip this step.

### Step 2 — Turn Off Antivirus

Disable **Real-time Protection** in Windows Defender (or your third-party antivirus) before downloading.

See [Installation](installation.md) for how to add exclusions so you don't need to turn it off every time.

### Step 3 — Download the Game from Steam

With the game version locked and antivirus off, download the game normally from Steam. Wait for it to fully complete.

### Step 4 — Apply Bypass

1. Open **Steam Unlock ONENNABE**
2. Go to the **Library** tab
3. Find the game
4. Click **Bypass Game**

---

## Launch Options

After bypass is applied, you have three ways to launch the game:

### Option 1 — Launch from ONENNABE (Recommended)

1. Open **Steam Unlock ONENNABE**
2. Go to the **Library** tab
3. Click the game → click **Play**
4. Choose the `.exe` file **or** choose `HV-PlugNPlay.bat` / `HV-Launcher.bat`

!!! warning "Windows 11 Only"
    `HV-PlugNPlay.bat` and `HV-Launcher.bat` only work on **Windows 11**.

### Option 2 — Launch Directly from File

Navigate to the game's install folder and run:

- `HV-PlugNPlay.bat`, or
- `HV-Launcher.bat`, or
- `[GAMENAME].exe`

### Option 3 — Launch from Steam (with HV Launch Option)

To launch from Steam directly, you must first inject the HV launch option via ONENNABE:

```
SUO > Tools > Inject HV Launch Option
```

After injecting, you can launch the game normally from Steam.
